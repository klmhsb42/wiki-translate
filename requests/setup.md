Hello world, This is Syncloud and I will show you how to setup your device.

Syncloud is [free and open source](https://github.com/syncloud/platform/blob/master/LICENSE). All your data will be stored at home, which you can easily access from all over the world.

First, it’s time to get a Syncloud device. 

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/13.png" alt="" width="400"/>

You can buy a plug-and-play device in our shop. You can find our shop under https://shop.syncloud.org.

---

Later, you must connect your device to your router and depending on the device type, to an [external storage](https://github.com/syncloud/platform/wiki/External-Disk), as well. We offer two types of devices.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/15.png" alt="" width="400"/>

One type, which requires an external storage.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/16.png" alt="" width="400"/>

And another type, which has already an internal storage and does not require an external storage. However, you can still use an external storage if you want. Keep in mind, that you can use only one storage a time.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/18.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Add the device of choice to the shopping cart.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/20.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Get your device delivered to any country.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/21.png" alt="" width="400"/>

And fall in love, when you hold it first time in your hands.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/22.png" alt="" width="400"/>

In a second step, you must connect everything.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/23.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Plug in your device to power supply and connect it with your router by a ethernet cable.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/25.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Depending on your device type, plug in an external storage, as well.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/26.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Now, there comes the [activation](https://github.com/syncloud/platform/wiki/Device-activation).

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/27.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Connect your smartphone to the Wifi of your router.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/28.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Download our [Syncloud app](https://github.com/syncloud/platform/wiki/Syncloud-Mobile-App) for Android or your iPhone.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/29.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Open the app and sign in. You can use your username and password from your shop [account](https://github.com/syncloud/platform/wiki/Accounts).

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/30.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Then, press the plus button to search your device. If you have found it, click on the device name.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/31.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Your browser will open, and the activation interface should appear. If there is a security warning, you can click on more or advanced and accept the risk.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/32.png" alt="" width="400"/>

You will see the activation interface.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/33.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Type in your Email address and password same as in the shop or in the app. Type in a name you want to have for your device. With this URL, you will later access your device by the browser.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/34.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Create then an [account](https://github.com/syncloud/platform/wiki/Accounts) with which you can sign into your device later. Use any username and password.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/35.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Press then activation. This can take a few minutes. 

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/36.png" alt="" width="400"/>

After that, you will get redirect to your device user interface with your chosen URL. Same issue again, if there is a security warning, you can click on more or advanced and accept the risk. A [certificate](https://github.com/syncloud/platform/wiki/Custom-certificate) will be created for you soon to allow a secure access to your device. If you don’t have a certificate till next day, please contact our support.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/37.png" alt="" width="400"/>

If you can not access the device user interface by your URL, there is probably a so called [DNS rebind protection](https://github.com/syncloud/platform/wiki/External-access) in your router settings. Please browse to the web interface of your router and check for DNS rebind protection under your network settings. Add an exception for the domain https://syncloud.it. Now, you should be able to access your device by your URL. If not, please contact our support.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/38.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Now, you can make your device [accessible from extern](https://github.com/syncloud/platform/wiki/External-access), if you want. For that, you must find out if you have version 4 or version 6 of IP address.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/39.png" alt="" width="400"/>

That, you can find out in your device user interface under settings. Click then on Network. If you have IPv6, it will appear with the IP address of your device.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/40.png" alt="" width="400"/>

With IPv6 you can access your device from extern by default, so you don’t have to activate external access in the device settings. However, you must know, that you can only access from an IPv6 network and that you cannot access from an IPv4 network. Sadly, many public networks like of companies or schools and many mobile networks do not have IPv6 support.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/43.png" alt="" width="400"/>

If you have IPv4, you must enable external access in your device settings. You must open two ports in your router called 80 and 443. You can try to do this with auto mode and save. Sometimes it fails. However, there is no reason to worry.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/44.png" alt="" width="400"/>

You probably must enable UPnP in your router settings. Then try it again.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/45.png" alt="" width="400"/>

If it fails again, you must open the two ports manually in your router settings. Open 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/46.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Then, type 80 and 443 in the input fields in the device user interface and save. Now, you should be able to enable external access. If not, please contact our [support](syncloud@syncloud.it).

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/47.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Now, you are ready to discover and enjoy your new device.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/48.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Go to our app center to install an [app](https://github.com/syncloud/platform/wiki/App-access). Click on any app, for example Nextcloud.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/50.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Click on Install and wait untill the Open button appears. Enjoy your new app. Besides that, you can upgrade, backup or remove the app.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/51.png" alt="" width="400"/>

For some apps, you have to open ports in your router.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/52.png" alt="" width="400"/>

For example, the [Mail server](https://github.com/syncloud/platform/wiki/Mail) app needs open port 25.

---

<img src="https://github.com/syncloud/stuff/blob/master/demo/20200415/frames/53.png" alt="" width="400"/>

Or the [OpenVPN](https://github.com/syncloud/platform/wiki/VPN) app needs open port 1194. You can find further information in our documentation.
